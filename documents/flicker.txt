The Videx 80 column cards have an interesting hardware bug. The video RAM was mapped into the 2K memory from $C800 to $CFFF that was shared by all the card slots. Each card was required to have a flip-flop that was set by access to the ROM memory mapped for that card slot, and reset by any access to address $CFFF. The output of that flip-flop determined whether or not the expansion ROM on a given card would respond to an address in the $C800 to $CFFF range. To avoid flickering of the display while the CPU was accessing the video memory, the hardware would blank the display for a microsecond every time the CPU accessed the video memory. The problem is that the blanking system did not take into account the state of that flip-flop when blanking the display. This means that the 80 column video display would completely break up any time any other card was accessing the shared memory space on that other card.  I first encountered the fault when displaying 80 columns and trying to print something with the Apple Silentype printer, but many other printer cards would do the same thing.  As I recall, the fix involved cutting one trace and adding a short bodge wire.
