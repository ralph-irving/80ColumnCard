Differences of CRTC models

(C) 1999-2006 Andr? Fachat

I have gathered together the differences between CRTC models from various sources. The docs to

    Rockwell 6545-1
    Motorola 6845, 6845-1, 68A45, 68A45-1, 68B45, 68B45-1
    Hitachi 46505
    Commodore 6545-1

have been taken from http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/documents/chipdata/index.html. The Motorola chips are actually only two different chips, namely 6845 and 6845-1, with different speed ratings ("", "A", "B"). I will therefore only use the names without speed ratings. I checked the Motorola 6845 with my private docs, and added the

    Rockwell 6545, 6545E

docs from my Rockwell International 1987 Controller Products Data Book. Again the only difference I found between those two chips was the maximum allowed clock frequency (2.5 MHz vs. 3.7 MHz for the R6545E).

I will not go into details that are common to all chips. If you have further questions please refer to the CRTC documentation on http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/documents/chipdata/index.html and http://www.6502.org/documents/datasheets/.

Pinout
Although the pin naming is different, the pinout itself is the same for all chips, and all pins have the same meaning.
 
Status Register
The Status register is read when the register select (RS) pin is low (when writing to this address, the index in the CRTC register file is written).

Commodore 6545-1, Rockwell 6545-1

	Bits 0-4: not used

	Bit 5: 0= scan currently not in vertical blanking portion
	       1= scan is currently in vertical blanking portion [1]

	Bit 6: LPEN register full
	       0= goes to 0 whenever R16 or R17 are read
	       1= goes 1 when an LPEN strobe occurs

	Bit 7: not used

Rockwell 6545

	Bits 0-6: see Rockwell 6545-1

	Bit 7: Update Ready
	       0= register 16 or 17 has been read by the CPU
  	       1= an update strobe has been occurred.

Motorola 6845, 6845-1, Hitachi 46505

	The status register is not mentioned at all...

[1] The Rockwell 6545 docs say that this bit "switches state at end of
    last displayed rasterline" and "goes to a 0 five character clock times 
    before vertical retrace ends to ensure that critical timings for
    refresh RAM is met."
	

 
Register File
The following registers are basically the same for all chips (see notes):

R0	Horizontal Total (-1)
R1 	Horizontal Display
R2	Horizontal Sync position [1]

R4	Vertical total character lines (-1) (7 bit)
R5	Vertical total adjust rasterlines (5 bit)
R6	Vertical displayed character lines (7 bit)
R7	Vertical Sync position (7 bit) [1]

R9	Number of rasterlines per characterline (-1) [2]
R10	Cursor start rasterline + cursor mode control (5+2 bit)
R11	Cursor end rasterline (5 bit)
R12	Display start address high (6 bit) [3]
R13	Display start address low (8 bit) [3]
R14	Cursor address high (6 bit)
R15	Cursor address low (8 bit)
R16	Lightpen address high (6 bit)
R17	Lightpen address low (8 bit)

[1] Motorola states that "(Set data) = (Designated Data) - 1",
    as it is known for R0, R4, and R9
[2] Commodore does not mention the "-1"
[3] It is possible to read R12 and R13 on Motorola CRTCs only.
    All others can only read R14-R17.
	

Reading unused bits where possible reads a "0", which is, however, only explicitly stated in the Commodore docs.
 
The major differences in the register file
The following items describe the major register file differences.

    R3, sync widths

    Motorola 6845, Hitachi 46505:

    	Bits 0-3: horizontal sync width in character times. Value=0 -> 16
    	Bits 4-7: unused

    Commodore 6545-1, Rockwell 6545 and 6545-1, Motorola 6845-1:

    	Bits 0-3: horizontal sync width in character times. Value=0 -> 16
    	Bits 4-7: vertical sync width in rasterlines. Value=0 -> 16

    R8, Mode Control

    Commodore 6545-1 and Rockwell 6545-1:

    	Bit 0,1: Interlace control 
    	   value of bits (1/0):
    		x0: non-interlace [Rockwell says "Bit 0 must program to 0"]
    		x1: invalid "do not use" [Rockwell says "not used"]

    	Bit 2:  0 = straight binary addressing
    		1 = row/column addressing (see below)

    	Bit 3:  "Must Program to '0'"

    	Bit 4:  Display Enable Skew 
    		0 = no delay
    		1 = delay Display Enable for one character clock cycle

    	Bit 5:  Cursor Enable Skew
    		0 = no delay
    		1 = delay Cursor Enable for one character clock cycle

    	Bit 6,7: not used

    Rockwell 6545:

    	Bits 0,1: Interlace control, see Motorola 6545
     
    	Bit 2: Addressing Mode, see Rockwell 6545-1

    	Bit 3: Refresh RAM access
    	       0= shared memory access
    	       1= transparent memory access

    	Bit 4/5: display enable and cursor skew. See Rockwell 6545-1

    	Bit 6: Update Strobe (Transparent mode):
    	       0= Pin 34 functions as memory address (RA4)
    	       1= Pin 34 functions as update strobe

    	Bit 7: Update/Read mode (Transparent mode):
    	       0= Update occurs during horizontal and vertical blanking
    	       1= Update interleaves during Phi2 portion of cycle

    Motorola 6845 and Hitachi 46505

    	Bit 0,1: Interlace control (see below)
    	   value of bits (1/0):
    		x0: non-interlace, normal mode
    		01: interlace mode
    		11: interlace and video mode
    		
    	Bit 2-7: not used

    Motorola 6845-1

    	Bit 0-3: see Motorola 6845

    	Bit 4,5: Display Enable Skew
    	   value of bits (5/4):
    		00: no delay
    		01: delay Display Enable for one character clock cycle
    		10: delay Display Enable for two character clock cycles
    		11: not available

    	Bit 6,7: Display Enable Skew
    	   value of bits (7/6):
    		00: no delay
    		01: delay Cursor Enable for one character clock cycle
    		10: delay Cursor Enable for two character clock cycles
    		11: not available

    What can be learned already from this diagram? The Motorola 6845 (or the Hitachi 46505, but unlikely) was first and defined a basic set of features. Rockwell and Commodore then used the same derivation from the original design, while Motorola developed slightly different features. However, looking at the "must program to 0" entries, it seems Rockwell was not quick enough to implement the interlace modes and thus released an early version as 6545-1, before getting the full 6545 done, with some additional features.
